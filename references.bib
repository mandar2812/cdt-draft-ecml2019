 abstract = {There occurs on some occasions a difficulty in deciding the direction of causality between two related variables and also whether or not feedback is occurring. Testable definitions of causality and feedback are proposed and illustrated by use of simple two-variable models. The important problem of apparent instantaneous causality is discussed and it is suggested that the problem often arises due to slowness in recording information or because a sufficiently wide class of possible causal variables has not been used. It can be shown that the cross spectrum between two variables can be decomposed into two parts, each relating to a single causal arm of a feedback situation. Measures of causal lag and causal strength can then be constructed. A generalisation of this result with the partial cross spectrum is suggested.},

abstract = {We present a statistical study of the performance of three methods used to predict the propagation delay of solar wind structures. These methods are based on boundary normal estimations between the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft orbiting the L1 libration point and the Cluster spacecraft near the Earth's magnetopause. The boundary normal estimation methods tested are the cross product method (CP), the minimum variance analysis of the magnetic field (MVAB), and the constrained minimum variance analysis (MVAB0). The estimated delay times are compared with the observed ones to obtain a quantitative measure of each method's accuracy. Boundary normal estimations of magnetic field structures embedded in the solar wind are known to be sensitive to small-scale fluctuations. Our study uses wavelet denoising to reduce the effect of these fluctuations. The influence of wavelet denoising on the performance of the three methods is also analyzed. We find that the free parameters of the three methods have to be adapted to each event in order to obtain accurate propagation delays. We also find that by using denoising parameters optimized to each event, 88\% of our database of 356 events are estimated to arrive within Â±2 min from the observed time delay with MVAB, 74\% with CP, and 69\% with the MVAB0 method. Our results show that wavelet denoising significantly improves the predictions of the propagation time delay of solar wind discontinuities.}
