Assumptions made:
Model 1-2
Possible limitation: depends only on instant t; 
but the model can involve the speed...

Add noise in (1-2).

Relation with Granger/causality
Eichler paper: what are the assumptions ? 
* linearity of y.
* dependence on the set of variables: no confounder;
* unobserved variables (here, magnetic, starting under the surface...)
* in fact, there are confounders.
