Stability metric
the second derivative of \cal L wrt alpha is
 C_2[p]-2C_1[p]^2 instead of C_2[p]-2C_1[p] 
 so the necessary condition for stability is C_2 < 2C_1^2  (sorry for that)

In the mail, discussed how to use this to update the hyper-parameters.
But too expensive in each time step.

Using eq 5, numerical instability.
The Z is difficult to train; (although using the explicit gradient)

Mandar tried 
Eq. 5; F (Appendix A); and Eq. 12.
Pb with the first 2: value for C_1, C_2 were not converging.
But with Eq. 12, converging toward stable point.

s_0 is \sigma_0**2 

Link between the two p_i: (Cyril and Mandar).
In the alternating version, p_i is not converging. 

Singular solution; the system is converging to; \hat p constant (i.e., not depending on x). WHY ?

Same \hat p over different runs ?

Pb of saturation. look at the distribution of your predictors for the time lag.
Could be something in the data; fooling the predictor. 

Wind: 
if there are exceptional events, could replace this with the rank.
